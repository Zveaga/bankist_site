# Bankist Site
This project is a simple banking website to demonstrate the use of the
DOM tree features such as event propagation and event delegation.

## How to run
- Clone the repository and open the index.html page to open the website
- Start experimenting with the website's [features](#app-features) 

## App Features
- Reveal elements when scrolling:<br>
Sections are revealed as the user scrolls the page
- Page Navigation<br>
Users can navigate to different sections using the top navigation bar links
- Smooth scrolling:<br>
Navigate to the website's sections with a smooth effect
- Slider component <br>
A slider element implemented to display testimonials. Clicking on the left/right
arrow buttons or pressing the left/right keyboard arrows allows the user to navigate
through the slides
- Lazy loading images <br>
When the website first loads, images are displayed in a small size with a blur effect.
As the user scrolls down, the images are displayed in full size and the blur effect removed. This improves website load times.
